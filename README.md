🖼️ Multi-Format Batch Image ConverterThis repository contains the source code for a Python Mini Project developed for the UE25CS151A course, focusing on the Image Processing domain. The application is a GUI utility built using wxPython that allows users to batch convert, process, and compress images to meet a specific file size target.Project FeaturesBatch Processing: Convert multiple images (JPEG, PNG, etc.) in a single operation.Format Conversion: Output images to common formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, TIFF, BMP).Image Manipulation: Optional Grayscale Conversion2.Advanced Compression: Uses an iterative algorithm to find the optimal quality setting required to achieve a user-defined Target File Size (KB), addressing the 'Innovation/Effort' criteria3.📂 Modular Project StructureThe project is structured into four separate files to clearly define team member responsibilities, aligning with the project guidelines4.File NameResponsibilitymain_app.pyApplication Controller: The main entry point. Initializes the GUI and manages the overall batch execution flow.gui_layout.pyUI Design: Contains all the code for constructing the wxPython graphical interface elements (buttons, sliders, grids).image_utils.pyFile Core: Handles low-level file operations, including image loading, format mapping, and final image saving.compression_logic.pyAlgorithm: Contains the core iterative function to calculate the quality needed for the target file size (KB).🚀 Getting Started (How to Run)1. PrerequisitesYou must have Python installed. This project requires the following third-party libraries5:Bashpip install wxpython
pip install pillow
2. ExecutionClone this repository to your local machine.Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.Run the main application file:Bashpython main_app.py
3. UsageClick "Select Images (Batch)" and choose the files you wish to process.Select your desired Output Format.Adjust the Quality Slider or check the Enable Target File Size (KB) box and enter a value (e.g., 50).Click "Start Batch Conversion" and select your desired output folder.The application will process the files and display the total file size savings.📄 Submission DetailsThis repository and its working code fulfill the digital submission requirement6. The companion Hardcopy Report includes the detailed Problem Statement, Approach Used, and Challenges Faced, covering the remaining evaluation rubric
